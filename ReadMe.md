The Reminder App

Developed by Evan Barmes


Features:

[Fig 1](https://github.com/EvanBarmes/Reminder/blob/master/Figures/Fig1.png) - The main window of the app displays the user’s current reminders.

[Fig 2](https://github.com/EvanBarmes/Reminder/blob/master/Figures/Fig2.png) - The “Create New Reminder” button opens a new window allowing the user to configure a new reminder. The user can name the reminder, select a specific time, and optionally make the reminder reoccurring.

[Fig 3](https://github.com/EvanBarmes/Reminder/blob/master/Figures/Fig3.png) - From the main window, selecting one of the buttons with a reminder title will open a window similar to the “New Reminder” window but pre-filled with the reminder’s specifications. From here the user can view the reminder’s details and make any desired changes.

[Fig 4](https://github.com/EvanBarmes/Reminder/blob/master/Figures/Fig4.png) - The user can quickly disable/enable reminders without having to delete and recreate them by using the correlating button to the left of the reminder to be affected.

[Figs 5](https://github.com/EvanBarmes/Reminder/blob/master/Figures/Fig5.png) - Pressing the button to the left of “Create New Reminder” enters the enable/disable buttons into delete mode, in which the user can easily delete as many reminders as desired all from the main window. The same button returns the delete buttons to their enable/disable state.

[Fig 6](https://github.com/EvanBarmes/Reminder/blob/master/Figures/Fig6.png) - The user is presented with a simple reminder at the specified time.
